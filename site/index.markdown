# :hotsprings: Project Yellowstone: Old Faithful

Old Faithful is the project to make all of Solana's history accessible, content addressable and available via a variety of means. The goal of this project is to completely replace the Bigtable dependency for Solana history access with a self-hostable, decentralized history archive that is usable for infrastructure providers, individual Solana users, explorers, indexers, and anyone else in need of historical access.
