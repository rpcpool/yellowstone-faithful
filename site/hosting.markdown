# Hosting Faithful archives

You can download and host the faithful archives using any file system data source or HTTP endpoint that supports range requests. To host archives or indexes all you need to do is [generate](/archives/dataprep/) or [download](/rpc-server/old-faithful-net/) Epoch car files or indexes. You can then use the config file syntax or command line to serve these car files.
