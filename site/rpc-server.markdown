# RPC Server

The Old Faithful RPC server allows you to run a Solana compatible RPC server to service data from various sources. The RPC server currently supports:

 - getBlock
 - getTransaction
 - getSignaturesForAddress

It can query data from multiple locations:

 - [old-faithful.net](/rpc-server/old-faithful-net/) archives hosted by Triton One
 - Local files either generated by yourself or downloaded from old-faithful.net, see [old-faithful.net for more details](/rpc-server/old-faithful-net/)
 - [Filecoin](/filecoin/), you can use the faithful-cli to directly interface with the Filecoin network for data access
 - Any HTTP source that supports HTTP RANGE requests, to host your own archives see details about [hosting](/archives/hosting/)

## Quickstart: RPC server from old-faithful.net

We are hosting data on old-faithful.net for testing and cloning purposes. This allows you to run a sample test server without downloading any data. There is a simple tool that you can run for this available from [https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-faithful/tree/main/tools](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-faithful/tree/main/tools). You can run a fully remote server like this:

```
$ ./tools/run-rpc-server-remote.sh 0
```

This will create a server that hosts epoch 0.

If you want to test a recent epoch you can run:
```
$ ./tools/run-rpc-server-remote.sh 475
```

While this is a possible runtime scenario, for blocks this is very, very slow. We recommend downloading indexes locally but keeping the data remote for good performance. See this more as a demonstration that a fully remote use scenario is theoretically possible. More details about how to run with local indexes can be found [here](rpc-server/old-faithful-net/).

New epochs are being added continuously, but the upload cadence is currently a little irregular due to pipeline development work.
